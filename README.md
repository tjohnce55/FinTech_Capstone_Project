## **_Overview/Goal:_**
The goal of our project is to create a web application (using Streamlit) that will allow the user to 
simplify their stock analysis. The user will be able to enter a stock’s ticker and view the 
historical price of that stock, some of the company’s fundamentals, and recent news articles for 
the stock. They will also be able to run Monte Carlo Simulations to forecast future stock prices.
