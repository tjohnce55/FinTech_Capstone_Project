## **_Overview/Goal:_**
The goal of our project is to create a web application (using Streamlit) that will allow the user to 
simplify their stock analysis. The user will be able to enter a stock’s ticker and view the 
historical price of that stock, some of the company’s fundamentals, and recent news articles for 
the stock. They will also be able to run Monte Carlo Simulations to forecast future stock prices.

## **_Questions:_**
1. What libraries will we need in order to complete this project and accomplish our goal?
2. What data will we need to gather? Where will we get the data?
3. What tools/features will the application provide for the user?
4. How will the application help the user better understand their investment options?
