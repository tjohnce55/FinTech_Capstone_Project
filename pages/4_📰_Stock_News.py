"""
This page will allow the user to enter a stock ticker and obtain some of the most recent news articles relating to that company.

When an error occurs, or exception, Python will stop and generate an error message.
We will handle these exceptions using the try and except statements.
If the user enters an invalid ticker they will be asked to reenter a valid ticker rather than Python giving them an error message.
