"""
This page will allow the user to enter a stock ticker and a date range of their choosing, and view the price movement of that stock over that time period.
They will also be able to see the highest price, lowest price, and price difference and percent change over that time period.

When an error occurs, or exception, Python will stop and generate an error message.
We will handle these exceptions using the try and except statements.
If the user enters an invalid ticker they will be asked to reenter a valid ticker rather than Python giving them an error message.
