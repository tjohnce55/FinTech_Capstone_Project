"""
This page will allow the user to enter a stock ticker and a hypothetical investment amount.
The tool will use the inputs, gather five years of historical data for that stock, and run a Monte Carlo Simulation to forecast.
They will also be able to see the simulated cumulative return and the simulated value of their investment over the next three years.

When an error occurs, or exception, Python will stop and generate an error message.
We will handle these exceptions using the try and except statements.
If the user enters an invalid ticker they will be asked to reenter a valid ticker rather than Python giving them an error message.
